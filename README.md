# trading-app
Asset-trading app that leverages the Yahoo-Finance api to get real time stock and crypto quotes.


The program allows users to create an account, and once created, to access the services of the app. Users can deposit, withdraw, buy and sell stocks and cryptocurrencies. Searching is done through tickers and prices are collected from Yahoo Finance in real time.

I developed it for my Object-oriented programming module, and therefore, that paradigm has been my design approach.

Below you can see a UML diagram depicting the relationship between the files:

And here is a little demo of how it looks. The GUI has been made through "swing", although it wasn't a requirement for the miniproject.
